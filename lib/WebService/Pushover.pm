=head1 NAME

WebService::Pushover - interface to Pushover API

=head1 VERSION

This document describes WebService::Pushover version 1.0.0.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use WebService::Pushover;

    my $push = WebService::Pushover->new(
        user_token => 'PUSHOVER USER TOKEN',
        api_token  => 'PUSHOVER API TOKEN',
    ) or die( "Unable to instantiate WebService::Pushover.\n" );

    my %params = (
        message  => 'test test test',
        priority => 0,
    );

    my $status = $push->message( %params );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a Perl wrapper around the Pushover
( L<http://pushover.net> ) RESTful API.  You'll need to register with
Pushover to obtain an API token for yourself and for your application
before you'll be able to do anything with this module.

=head1 INTERFACE

=over 4

=item new(I<%params>)

Creates an object that allows for interaction with Pushover. The following
are valid arguments; all are optional:

=over 4

=item base_url B<OPTIONAL>

Sets the base URL for the API to connect to. Defaults to L<http://api.pushover.net>

=item user_token B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover user token, obtained by registering at L<http://pushover.net>.
If specified, will be used as a default in any call that requires a user token.

=item api_token B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover application token, obtained by registering at L<http://pushover.net/apps>.
If specified, will be used as a default in any call that requires an API token.

=item debug B<OPTIONAL>

Set this to a true value in order to enable tracing of API call operations.

=back

=item debug()

I<debug()> returns 1 if debugging is enabled, and 0 otherwise.

=item message(I<%params>)

I<message()> sends a message to Pushover and returns a scalar reference
representation of the message status.  The following are valid parameters:

=over 4

=item token B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover application token.
If not specified, the C<api_token> specified in C<new> will be used.

=item user B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover user token.
If not specified, the C<user_token> specified in C<new> will be used.

=item device B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover device name; if not supplied, the user will be validated if at
least one device is registered to that user.

=item title B<OPTIONAL>

A string that will appear as the title of the message; if not supplied, the
name of the application registered to the application token will appear.

=item message B<REQUIRED>

A string that will appear as the body of the message.

=item timestamp B<OPTIONAL>

The desired message timestamp, in Unix epoch seconds.

=item priority B<OPTIONAL>

Set this value to "2" to mark the message as emergency priority, "1" to mark
the message as high priority, set it to "-1" to mark the message as low
priority, or set it to "0" or leave it unset for standard priority.

=item retry B<OPTIONAL>

You must pass this parameter when sending messages at emergency priority.  Set
this value to the number of seconds before Pushover tries again to obtain
confirmation of message receipt.

=item expire B<OPTIONAL>

You must pass this parameter when sending messages at emergency priority.  Set
this value to the number of seconds before Pushover stops trying to obtain
confirmation of message receipt.

=item url B<OPTIONAL>

A string that will be attached to the message as a supplementary URL.

=item url_title B<OPTIONAL>

A string that will be displayed as the title of any supplementary URL.

=item sound B<OPTIONAL>

Select a sound to be associated with this notification.  Check the Pushover API
documentation for valid values.

=back

=item user(I<%params>)

I<user()> sends an application token and a user token to Pushover and
returns a scalar reference representation of the validity of those tokens.  The
following are valid parameters:

=over 4

=item token B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover application token.
If not specified, the C<api_token> specified in C<new> will be used.

=item user B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover user token.
If not specified, the C<user_token> specified in C<new> will be used.

=item device B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover device name; if not supplied, the message will go to all devices
registered to the user token.

=back

=item receipt(I<%params>)

I<receipt()> sends an application token and a receipt token to Pushover and
returns a scalar reference representation of the confirmation status of the
notification associated with the receipt.  The following are valid parameters:

=over 4

=item token B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover application token.
If not specified, the C<api_token> specified in C<new> will be used.

=item receipt B<REQUIRED>

The Pushover receipt token, obtained by parsing the output returned after
sending a message with emergency priority.

=back

=item sounds(I<%params>)

I<sounds()> sends an application token to Pushover and returns a hash reference
listing the available sounds (suitable for passing to the I<sound> parameter of
the I<message()>.  The following are valid parameters:

=over 4

=item token B<OPTIONAL>

The Pushover application token.
If not specified, the C<api_token> specified in C<new> will be used.

=back

=back

=head2 DEPRECATED METHODS

The following methods are depreated, and will be removed in a future
release. They remain for now to provide backwards compatibility.

=over

=item push(I<%params>)

I<push()> is a B<DEPRECATED> alias for I<message()>.

=item tokens(I<%params>)

I<tokens()> is a B<DEPRECATED> alias for I<user()>.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Inspect the value returned by any method, which will be a Perl data structure
parsed from the JSON or XML response returned by the Pushover API.
